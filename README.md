The truth is out there.

THEY are out there.

This repo contains homework number 13 for the University of Denver's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

We were provided a data set via an array of dictionaries in a JavaScript file and a starter HTML file to serve as a template.

To complete the assignment, I created a second JavaScript file (index.js) containing instructions to populate a table in the html with data from the provided file.  Then I added in the ability to filter the data by date using a user input form that can be submitted by hitting "Enter" or by clicking the "Filter Table" button.

Thanks for reading!
